<h3> WordExcerpt </h3>
<p> Below are a few examples of my work for WordExcerpt, a US based publishing company focused on the acquisition of eastern literature and localizing into English. As a graphic artist, my job is to create English titles for Korean covers, and try to replicate the original text and style as much as possible. </p>
