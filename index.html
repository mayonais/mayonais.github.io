# My Background
I was born in New York, but I spent most of my formative years in China. When I came back to the states, I briefly lived in California, then Oregon. I spent five years in Texas, the longest time I had spent in any place. When high school started, I moved to New Hampshire. Two years later, I moved to New York. During covid, I stayed in Vermont before moving to Chicago. In a few months time, I will be attending McGill University in Montreal, Canada.
